# Minesweeper-Auto-Player
Using Python, I programmed an auto-player for a real Minesweeper game from this site:
[https://minesweeper.online/](https://minesweeper.online/)

To run the code you must set these values:

    grid_side_length = 760  # the game side length in pixels
	
	# the most left-up corner position
    start_x = 1022
    start_y = 220
